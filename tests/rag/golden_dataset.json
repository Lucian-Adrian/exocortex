Users can query pending commitments and get reminders about upcoming deadlines.",

      "expected_answer": "Exo uses Google's text-embedding-004 model for generating vector embeddings. These embeddings enable semantic search by converting text into high-dimensional vectors that capture meaning, allowing the system to find relevant content even when exact keywords don't match.",

      "expected_answer": "You can ingest content via POST /api/memories with a JSON body containing: text (the content), source_type (markdown, url, slack, or transcript), and optional source_url. The API requires authentication via X-API-Key header. The response includes the created memory ID, generated summary, and extracted entities.",

      "query": "What is the difference between semantic search and keyword search in Exo?",
      "expected_answer": "Semantic search in Exo uses AI embeddings to find content based on meaning, not just exact word matches. This means a query about 'revenue growth' can find documents discussing 'sales increase' or 'profit improvement'. Keyword search would only match exact terms. Semantic search returns results ranked by similarity score.",
      "context": [
        "Exo uses vector embeddings for semantic search.",
        "Semantic search compares meaning rather than exact words.",
        "Similarity scores range from 0.0 to 1.0.",

Each source type is processed and enriched with AI-generated summaries and entity extraction.",
